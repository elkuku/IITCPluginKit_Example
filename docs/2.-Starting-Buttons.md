Expect the unexpected: the function `init()` is called on startup.  
So put there all your stuff you want to run on start.

# Toolbutton
Having the alert text poping up on every start is really annoying. Let's hide it behind a toolbox button - a link below the portal-detail view. Where most plugin will add a link:

``` javascript
init(): void {
    console.log("CountPortals " + VERSION);

    require("./styles.css");

    $("#toolbox").append(
        $("<a>", {
            text: "Count",
            click: () => this.doCount()
        })
    )
}


doCount(): void {
    alert("Hello World");
}
```

The "$" is JQuery. JQuery is a good old google framework helping us doing html stuff. Modern developers will tell you not to use it. And yes, they are right and wrong. Anyway, it's already included in IITC so let's make use of it to ease HTML creations. 

Here we create a `<a>` tag and add a "click" handler. This will call our new function which will hold our old `alert`.

# Toolbar Button
Some people prefer a quick access button on the left side of the map. Please think twice before adding it. Only use it for stuff that a user will use daily.
But hey, this is a tutorial: let's do it

- First we need an icon. Download and place it in your /src/ directory -> ...
Here we use SVG because it's simple and small but you're free to use any web-format you like.

- Import it at the top of your Main.ts:
```typescript
import * as Plugin from "iitcpluginkit";
import myicon from "./icon.svg";

class CountPortals implements Plugin.Class {
[...]
```

- Then create the toolbar button.
```typescript
init(): void {
    console.log("CountPortals " + VERSION);

    require("./styles.css");

    $("#toolbox").append(
        $("<a>", {
            text: "Count",
            click: () => this.doCount()
        })
    )


    const toolbarGroup = $("<div>", { class: "leaflet-bar leaflet-control" })
        .append(
            $("<a>")
                .addClass("leaflet-bar-part")
                .css("background-image", 'url("' + myicon + '")')
                .css("background-size", "24px")
                .click(() => this.doCount())
        );

    const parent = $(".leaflet-top.leaflet-left", window.map.getContainer()).first();
    parent.append(toolbarGroup);
}
```

We created a `<div>` for a new toolbar group and a `<a>` for a button with the image. 
Finally attached them to the global map container.

Make sure your "autobuild" command is still running. Open _**localhost:8100**_, update your script and reload iitc.
As you see you'll need these often. It's a good thing to keep localhost and iitc open in different tabs.

# CSS
Let keep our code clean and move the styles thing into another file. We already have a -sofar unused- file for it: style.css

styles.css:
```css
   .mybutton {
       background-image: url("./icon.svg");
       background-size: 24px;
   }
```

Main.ts (Line 19:):
```javascript
const toolbarGroup = $("<div>", { class: "leaflet-bar leaflet-control" })
    .append(
        $("<a>", {
            class: "mybutton leaflet-bar-part",
            click: () => this.doCount()
        })
    );
```


You'll see an error message in your terminal window because the icon import is nolonger required in Main.ts.
So remove this import line.

Last but not least let's do it little cleanup and move our stuff to an extra function to keep the "init" function easy to read:
```typescript
   init(): void {
        console.log("CountPortals " + VERSION);

        require("./styles.css");

        this.createButtons();
    }


    private createButtons(): void {
        $("#toolbox").append(
            $("<a>", {
                text: "Count",
                click: () => this.doCount()
            })
        )


        const toolbarGroup = $("<div>", { class: "leaflet-bar leaflet-control" })
            .append(
                $("<a>", {
                    class: "mybutton leaflet-bar-part",
                    click: () => this.doCount()
                })
            );

        const parent = $(".leaflet-top.leaflet-left", window.map.getContainer());
        parent.append(toolbarGroup);
    }
```

The "private" will let the compile know noone else will using this function. You can mark most of your functions private.
It won't help in final javascript but will help you trackdown obsolete functions.
